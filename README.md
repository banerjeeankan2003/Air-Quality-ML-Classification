# Air Quality ML Classification 

## Overview
- Designed and conducted a group research project that classified air quality levels (**Good**, **Moderate**, **Poor**, **Hazardous**) using a Kaggle dataset (5000 samples).
- Implemented, tuned, and evaluated **AdaBoost**, **Gradient Boosting**, **Random Forest**, and **Passive-Aggressive** classifiers to compare model performance.
- Visualized results with **confusion matrices**; interpreted feature importance and achieved a robust ensemble accuracy of **96.2%**.
- Collaborated with team members to preprocess data, tune hyperparameters, and optimize model accuracy and robustness.
